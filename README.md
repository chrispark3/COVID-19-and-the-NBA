# COVID-19 and the NBA
 
After the suspension of the 2019-2020 NBA Season due to COVID-19, the NBA implemented new rules and restrictions such as travel restrictions, little to no fan attendance, shortened offseason, shortened season, etc.) These limitations followed through into the 2020-2021 NBA Season. The motivation for this project was to see how various restrictions due to COVID-19 affected the 2020-2021 NBA Season. 

R Markdown was used to clean the data, display descriptive statistics (summary statistics, scatter plots and histograms), and inferential statistics (linear regression models) which ultimately revealed that the restrictions negatively affected the players' and teams' performance.

This study is generalizable to other sports since COVID-19 resulted in various rule changes and regulations in other leagues in the United States.

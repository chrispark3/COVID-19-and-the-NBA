# COVID-19 and the NBA
 
After the suspension of the 2019-2020 NBA Season due to COVID-19, the NBA implemented new rules and restrictions such as travel restrictions, little to no fan attendance, shortened offseason, shortened season, etc.) These limitations followed through into the 2020-2021 NBA Season. The motivation for this project was to see how various restrictions due to COVID-19 affected the 2020-2021 NBA Season. 

R Markdown was used to clean the data, display descriptive statistics (summary statistics, scatter plots, correlations and histograms), and display inferential statistics (linear regression models) which ultimately revealed that the restrictions negatively affected the players' and teams' performance. 

There were certain limitations that couldn't be accomplished due to time and resources. The challenge was separating COVID-19 caused differences from natural variability. The utilized datasets were cleaned so that the players included in the datasets played both seasons. This means that the player statistics datasets had to have the same players to make the scatterplots and correlations consistent. As a result, the descriptive statistics did not account for players injured in one season and returning in the next season. Also, it did not account for traded playesr who played on different teams in the same season because the data was cleaned so that the players would only be considered for the team they played more games for. 

The next step for this project is to compare home and away statistics/records in each season. This would check if there was a significant league wide difference between how players and teams performed at home versus on the road. Given that every team plays an equal number of home and away games with relatively equal competition when averaged out over the season and if the only difference between the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 regular season is COVID-19, then any difference in performance can be attributed to COVID-19.

This study is generalizable to other sports since COVID-19 resulted in various rule changes and regulations in other leagues in the United States.
